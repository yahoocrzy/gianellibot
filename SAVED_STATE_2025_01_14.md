# ClickBot Development State - January 14, 2025

## Current Status
The bot is functional with all major features implemented. The last issue fixed was timeout errors in task commands.

## Completed Features
1. ✅ Multi-workspace support for ClickUp
2. ✅ Claude AI integration for natural language task management
3. ✅ Calendar functionality with month/year dropdowns
4. ✅ All commands use dropdowns (no typing IDs)
5. ✅ Help pin system for channels
6. ✅ Fixed "application did not respond" errors in task commands
7. ✅ Purge function fixed (no longer hangs)
8. ✅ Reaction roles system
9. ✅ Moderation commands with advanced purge options

## Recent Fixes
- Fixed `/task-list` and `/task-create` timeout issues by:
  - Adding immediate `await interaction.response.defer(ephemeral=True)`
  - Replacing complex view patterns with direct dropdown implementations
  - Using `interaction.followup.send()` after deferring
  - Simplifying interaction flow for faster response times

## Known Issues to Address
- Need to verify all commands work without timeouts
- Should run comprehensive tests on all functionality

## Key Technical Decisions
- SQLAlchemy for database with encrypted token storage
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for external APIs
- Discord.py with slash commands
- Proper interaction deferral for long-running operations

## Important Files
- `cogs/clickup_tasks_enhanced.py` - Enhanced task commands with dropdowns
- `cogs/workspace_management.py` - Multi-workspace support
- `cogs/claude_setup.py` - Claude AI configuration
- `cogs/calendar_commands.py` - Calendar with dropdown date selection
- `utils/enhanced_selections.py` - Reusable dropdown components
- `database/models.py` - Database schema with workspace support

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive tests using `test_bot.py`
2. Verify all commands respond within Discord's timeout limits
3. Test multi-workspace switching functionality
4. Ensure Claude AI integration works properly
5. Verify calendar commands with dropdown selections

## Environment Setup
- Uses PostgreSQL or SQLite database
- Requires DISCORD_TOKEN and encryption key
- Optional: CLAUDE_API_KEY for AI features
- Web server on port 10000 for health checks

## Git Status
- Branch: main
- Modified: .claude/settings.local.json
- Untracked: BOT_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Recent commits show progression of features added

## User's Explicit Requirements
- Every command must use dropdowns, no typing IDs
- Multi-workspace support is essential
- Claude AI should handle all ClickUp operations via Discord
- Help pin system for easy command reference
- All commands must respond quickly without timeouts
