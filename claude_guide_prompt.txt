I need you to create a detailed user guide for setting up and using reaction roles in my Discord bot. Here's the technical information about the bot's reaction role system:

COMMAND REFERENCE:
- /reaction-roles-setup - Creates a new reaction role message in the current channel
- /reaction-roles-list - Shows all configured reaction roles for the server

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Bot uses SQLAlchemy database with ReactionRole model
- Supports custom embed colors (7-character hex codes like #FF0000)
- Has exclusive role support (removes other roles when assigning new one)
- Stores: guild_id, message_id, channel_id, emoji, role_id, exclusive flag, embed_color
- Bot automatically handles adding/removing roles when users react
- Requires Administrator permission to configure
- Bot needs "Manage Roles" permission and role hierarchy positioning

FEATURES:
- Multiple emoji-to-role mappings per message
- Custom embed titles, descriptions, and colors
- Exclusive vs non-exclusive role assignment
- Automatic cleanup when reactions are removed
- Works with both Unicode and custom emojis

SETUP PROCESS:
1. Run /reaction-roles-setup command
2. Customize embed appearance 
3. After message posts, react with desired emojis
4. Bot prompts to select roles for each emoji
5. Configure exclusive/non-exclusive behavior
6. Users can then react to get roles

Please create a comprehensive user guide that explains:
- How to set up reaction roles step-by-step
- How to customize the appearance 
- How exclusive vs non-exclusive roles work
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Best practices for organizing roles
- Required permissions and setup requirements

Make it beginner-friendly but thorough, with clear section headings and examples.
